Now let's move on to the Field class.
It will be responsible for storing information about which cells of the game field are currently occupied and which are empty.
Add the following two fields to the Field class: int width and int height.
We also need a matrix, i.e. a two-dimensional array: int[][] matrix;
In the same place, add getters for these variables.
Add a constructor that has two parameters: width and height. And don't forget about the matrix.

IMPORTANT!
A two-dimensional array can be represented as an array of arrays or as a rectangular matrix.
The first coordinate refers to the row, and the second refers to the column.
In other words, the cell with coordinates (x, y) is matrix[y][x].


Requirements:
1.	A private int width field must be created in the Field class.
2.	A private int height field must be created in the Field class.
3.	A private int[][] matrix field (a two-dimensional array of ints) must be created in the Field class.
4.	A proper getter for the height field must be created in the Field class.
5.	A proper getter for the width field must be created in the Field class.
6.	A proper getter for the matrix field must be created in the Field class.
7.	A properly working constructor with (int, int) parameters must be created in the Field class. The Matrix field must be initialized with a new array whose dimensions are [y][x] (height by width).


Tetris (part 5)


Now you need to create the Tetris object itself.
Add a static Tetris field to the Tetris class.
The game field must NOT be private.

Then in the main() method, create a Tetris object and save it in this variable.
Then add a call to the run() method.



Tetris (part 4)


We'll also need a couple of methods.
Add run() and step() methods to the Tetris class:

run() will be responsible for the entire game.
The step() method will be responsible for a single step in the game.

The return type is void for both methods.

From now on, if there are no explicit instructions about which access modifier to use, make methods public, and fields â€” private.

* In general, you should use the most restrictive access modifier you can.
* In other words, if the system's logic requires calls to a method from outside its class, then we can't make that method private.
* At the same time, there's no reason to make methods public if they will only be used within their package.
* This may seem insignificant at first, but it is actually one of the fundamental principles of OOP.
* Learn to do it correctly right from the start!



Tetris (part 3)


There's a field and a game piece, but how do we get them?

Add getters for the field and gamePiece fields.



Tetris (part 2)


Great!
Now add the following two fields to the Tetris class: Field field and GamePiece gamePiece.



Tetris (part 1)


Let's write Tetris!

Our Tetris game consists of two things: a game fields and game pieces that fall from above.
So to start, create three class: Field, GamePiece, and Tetris.

We will also need a method main() in the Tetris class.
