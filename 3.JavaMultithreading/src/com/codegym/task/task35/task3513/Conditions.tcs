We've implemented movement to the left. Now we need to implement the right, up, and down methods. I'm sure you can handle it
without my help, so I'll give you just one hint.

What happens if you rotate a two-dimensional array clockwise by 90 degrees, shift it to the left, and then
rotate three times?


Requirements:
1.	The up method should move the elements of the gameTiles array upward according to the rules of the game and, if necessary, add tiles using the addTile method.
2.	The up method should NOT modify the gameTiles array if a move upward is not possible.
3.	The down method should move the elements of the gameTiles array downward according to the rules of the game and, if necessary, add tiles using the addTile method.
4.	The down method should NOT modify the gameTiles array if a move downward is not possible.
5.	The right method should move the elements of the gameTiles array to the right according to the rules of the game and, if necessary, add tiles using the addTile method.
6.	The right method should NOT modify the gameTiles array if a move to the right is not possible.


2048 (part 6)


So, you've implemented tile consolidation and merging. The combination of these operations gives us the ability to move to the left.
Great! But we also need to add a new tile if the game board was changed by the movement.

Let's do the following:
1. Change the consolidateTiles method so that it returns true if it makes changes to the input array,
otherwise false.
2. Do the same for the mergeTiles method.
3. Implement the left method, which will call the consolidateTiles and mergeTiles methods for each row of the
gameTiles array and, if necessary, use the addTile method to add a tile.
4. The left method should not be private, since it will be called from the Controller class and elsewhere.



2048 (part 5)


The main actions that we need to enable are movements left, right, up and down.
If you've already played 2048, then you know that when you move in a direction, tiles
with values move to empty tiles, and tiles with the same value combine.

As a basic scenario, let's consider movement to the left and think about what happens when we want to do
this action.

For each row or column, two things actually happen:
a) Consolidate the tiles so that all the empty tiles are on the right, i.e.
the row {4, 2, 0, 4} becomes {4, 2, 4, 0}
b) Merge tiles with the same value, i.e. the row {4, 4, 2, 0} becomes {8, 2, 0, 0}.
Note that the row {4, 4, 4, 4} will become {8, 8, 0, 0}, and {4, 4, 4, 0} becomes {8, 4, 0 , 0}.

Create consolidateTiles(Tile[] tiles) and mergeTiles(Tile[] tiles) methods that implement steps
a) and b) respectively. We will use them only inside the Model class, so give them the narrowest
possible access.

Also, add int score and int maxTile fields, which should store the current score and the highest tile weight
on the game board. The score increases after each merger. For example, if the current score is 20 and
the row {4, 4, 4, 0} is merged, then the score should increase by 8. The access level for these fields should be wider than private.
The easiest thing to do is to update these fields in the mergeTiles method, for example:
1) If the tile merger condition is satisfied, check whether the new value is greater than the maximum value and,
if necessary, change the value of the maxTile field.
2) Increase the value of the score field by the amount of the tile weight generated by the merger.

P.S. When we implement the movement methods, tiles will always be consolidated before they are merged, so
you can assume that the mergeTiles method will always be passed an array of tiles that does not have empty tiles in the middle.



2048 (part 4)


The game 2048 begins on a board where two tiles already have initial values. But our board is still empty :(.
Before you rush to write code, let's think about how this could be implemented.

I suggest creating a private addTile method that will look at which tiles are empty. And if there are empty tiles, it will change the weight of one of them,
chosen at random, to 2 or 4 (there should be 1 four for every 9 twos). To get a random item from the list,
you can use the following expression: (list size * random number between zero and one).
You can also get empty tiles using a separate private getEmptyTiles method that returns a list
of the empty tiles in the gameTiles array.

After implementing the functionality for adding new tiles, add two addTile method calls to the constructor
to satisfy the task's starting condition.

P.S. Perhaps it would be worth it to move all the code from the constructor to a resetGameTiles method so that
starting a new game doesn't require creating a new model. You could instead simply return to the initial state
by calling this method. The access level should be wider than private.
P.P.S. To calculate the weight of a new tile, use the expression (Math.random () < 0.9 ? 2 : 4).



2048 (part 3)


Let's implement the Model class. It will be responsible for all manipulations performed on the game board.

But to manipulate the game board, we ought to start by creating it!

We're going to need:
1. A private constant FIELD_WIDTH = 4, which defines the width of the game board.
2. A private two-dimensional gameTiles array consisting of Tile objects.
3. A constructor without parameters that initializes the game board and populates it with empty tiles.



2048 (part 2)


In the game 2048 game, the board consists of 16 tiles, each of which has a certain weight.
In addition to weight, a tile has its own color and text color used to display the tile's weight.
Tile colors range from light gray to red, and the text color depends on the color of the tile.

Create a Tile class that will describe a single tile.
It will need the following:
1. An int value field with default access.
2. A constructor with a parameter that initializes the value field.
3. A constructor without parameters (initializes the value field to zero).
4. An isEmpty method that returns true if the value field is 0, otherwise false.
5. A getFontColor method that returns a new Color object (0x776e65)
if the tile weight is less than 16, otherwise 0xf9f6f2.
6. The getTileColor method, which returns the color of a tile depending on its weight, according to the
following values:
0:    (0xcdc1b4);
2:    (0xeee4da);
4:    (0xede0c8);
8:    (0xf2b179);
16:   (0xf59563);
32:   (0xf67c5f);
64:   (0xf65e3b);
128:  (0xedcf72);
256:  (0xedcc61);
512:  (0xedc850);
1024: (0xedc53f);
2048: (0xedc22e);

for any other values: (0xff0000).

The methods listed above should not be private.
