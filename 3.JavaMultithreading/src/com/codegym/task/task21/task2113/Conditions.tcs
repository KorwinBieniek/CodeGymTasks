There's just a little left to do: finish writing the Horse class.
The move method is called each time a horse takes a step.
When the move method is called on a horse, the horse must run a certain distance.
The distance depends on the horse's speed. In its simplest form, this method would look something like this:
distance += speed;

But to make it more interesting, let's make the speed change a little bit all the time.
To achieve this, multiply the speed by a random number.
A random number can be obtained using the Math.random() method.


Requirements:
1.	In the Horse class&#39;s move method, the value of the distance field must increase by the distance traveled in one &quot;step&quot; (value of the speed field) multiplied by a random number between zero and one obtained using the Math.random() method.


Hippodrome (part 11)


We're almost done with the Hippodrome class.
Add a call to run() at the end of the main method.

Hint:
The run() method is not static, so you can only call it on an object.
But where do you get the object?

Hint 2:
game.run();



Hippodrome (part 10)


We still need to write the Hippodrome class's print method.
Everything is simple here, too: In a loop, we call the print method on each horse.
Oh, and display 10 empty lines after the loop (using System.out.println()) to make it more beautiful.



Hippodrome (part 9)


Now let's return to the move and print methods. Let's start with move.
In the Hippodrome class's move method, we call the move method on each horse in the loop.

Yes, you're right: the Horse class doesn't have it yet.
This means you need to add your own move method to the Horse class. :)
Oh, and the print method, too.
If I don't say anything about a method's parameters, then the method doesn't have any parameters.
Make all of the methods public unless indicated otherwise.




Hippodrome (part 8)


Make a loop from 1 to 100 in the run method. This will be our race.
In the body of the loop, we'll call move first, then print.
To prevent the whole loop from finishing in a split second, add Thread.sleep(200); as well.



Hippodrome (part 7)


But that's not all. We need to make the horses run.
Add run, move, and print methods to the Hippodrome class. Without parameters.
The move method will control the movement of all horses.
The print method will draw them on the screen.
And the run method manages it all.
